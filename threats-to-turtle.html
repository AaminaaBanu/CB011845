<h1>Threats to turtle</h1>
<p>Illegal harvesting, habitat encroachment, and pollution are some major threats to turtles these days. Many turtles these days are in a threat of extintion due to faults caused by human beings. Protecting the nature is a responsibilty of every human being. In Sri Lanka we have the 5 speicies of sea turtle out of the 7 speicies in the world. It is a god's gift to us. But now it's endangered due to our actions.</p>

<h2>Illegal harvesting</h2>
<p>Hunters illegally hunt turtles for their meat, shells and skin, sometimes turtles are accidentally captured during fisheries.</p>
    <p> This has caused a huge harm to the already endangered species of turtles. And some conservation methods are already being taken to protect the existing turtles.</p>

    <h2>Consequences on Turtle due to Illeagal Harvesting</h2>
    <p>Since ancient times, hawksbill sea turtles have been hunted for their exquisite gold and brown shells, which are used to make jewelry and other high-end goods. These turtles are now classified as critically endangered as a result.
        Scientists believe that hawksbill populations have decreased by 90% during the previous 100 years, according to recent studies.
        While hawksbill sea turtles are the main target of the illicit sea turtle trade, other sea turtles may also be killed for their skin to create leather goods. If cosmetics contain sea turtle oil, they are likely to be banned.

    <h2>Habitat encroachment</h2>
    <P>Sea turtles are endangered due to coastal development. This includes seafloor alteration and shoreline, like nesting beach degradation, construction and vegetation. </P>

    <h2>Consequences on Turtle due to Habitat Encroachment</h2>
    <p>By interfering with the forces that naturally shape beaches and disrupting habitat,
         particularly sea turtle nesting habitat, coastal armoring such as sea walls, rock revetments,
          and other man-made structures can have a severe impact on coastal ecosystems and specially sea turtles. 
          Sand erosion in front of homes and other coastal structures is slowed or prevented by armoring.
           Unfortunately, sea barriers only temporarily slow down erosion's natural course and frequently speed up erosion on nearby stretches of beach. </p>

<h2>Pollution</h2>
<p>Pollution in the oceans and other water bodies has caused major harm to all aquatic animals including turtles. Transportation and dumping of garbages are major causes for these pollutions.  </p>

    <h2>Consequences on Turtle due to Pollution</h2>
    <p>Beaches and coastal waters are constantly in danger from pollution. Salt marshes, mangroves, and other coastal ecosystems are frequently contaminated by runoff from the mainland. Runoff from farms and lawns as well as other interior sources of pollution are carried by rivers that flow into these coastal seas. Additionally contributing to the degradation of our coastal waters are pesticides, fertilizers, oil spills, and sewage plant outflow. This has caused immense harm on species that live in the aquatic environment, including sea turtles.</p>

    <h2>Solutions to protect sea turtles from Pollutions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Clean habitats with polythenes and plastics</li>
