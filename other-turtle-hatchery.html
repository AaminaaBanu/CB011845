    <h1>Other Turtle Hatchery</h1>
<p>The hatchery and rescue facility currently cares for five different species of turtles. 
    These species include the Green Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, and Olive Ridley Turtle. Modern water tanks are included in the facilities at the sea turtle hatchery and rescue center,
     which also cares for adult turtle species that have been pulled from the water after suffering injuries. 
     The place where the turtles lay their eggs, which has distinct small mounds of sand piled neatly between one another, is one of the more odd sights in the center. 
     The turtle eggs' hatching process is carefully tracked at each of these mounds.</p>
